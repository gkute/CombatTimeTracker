  # "release" is a job, you can name it anything you want
  release:

    # we can run our steps on pretty much anything, but the "ubuntu-latest" image is a safe bet

                                  # file naming for alpha builds will not work properly

      # once cloned, we just run the GitHub Action for the packager project
